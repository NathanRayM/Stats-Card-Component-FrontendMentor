## About The Project

A perfect project for newbies who are starting to build confidence with layouts!
The main challenge is to build out this preview card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

## Built with

- HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

## What I learned

One of my challenges for this was getting the color over the image correct. I am still learning, and this challenge allowed me the opportunity to learn different ways to overlay colors to an image. My other challenges are media queries. This was my first challenge using media queries to make the design more responsive. I also did not have a figma for this challenge so I did it by eye.
